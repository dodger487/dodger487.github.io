Hello, this is my blog.

I write about data science and data projects.
And other stuff.

I'm currently a data scientist at [Propel](www.joinpropel.com) where I build software for low income Americans.
Previously, I was a machine learning engineer at the CashApp in Square, and before that I received a Ph.D. at Columbia University in Computer Science, where I did research on topics like machine learning, privacy, economics, and location data.
In NYC I spent a lot of time volunteering, teaching programming in local high schools with [ScriptEd](http://scripted.org) or on Rikers Island with [RikersBot](http://www.digitalstorytellinglab.com/projects/rikers-bot/)
