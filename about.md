Hello, this is my blog.

I'm a Ph.D. at Columbia University in Computer Science, where I do research on topics like machine learning, privacy, economics, and location data.
I spend a lot of time volunteering, teaching programming in local high schools with [ScriptEd](http://scripted.org) or on Rikers Island with [RikersBot](http://www.digitalstorytellinglab.com/projects/rikers-bot/)
I also like to draw birds.
I write about learning CS, data science, surviving grad school, privacy, and drawing birds.
